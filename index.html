            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>The Basement Lions strive to create an energetic community of engineers who build more than just robots.</p>
          </div>

          <p>Our diverse team of designers, builders, and coders unites in our home tucked away in the school’s basement. There, we spend countless hours tinkering, contemplating, and building in an atmosphere that’s both challenging and inviting. </p>

      <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
      <p>When six ambitious students decided to start a robotics team, they occupied just a small pocket in the corner of a student lounge. It was not long before the infectious passion of the founding members transformed the space around them; that corner grew large enough to be called a lab. The team's energy continued to spread, slipping through the shop walls and permeating throughout the whole school. Now, having seen robots involved in everything from dance recitals and diversity presentations to murder mysteries, every student is aware of robotics and the power of STEM.</p>
      <p>Our students don't only learn about STEM, but are taught as well to apply their newfound talents toward bettering their community.  Within our school, we have worked to foster a love for engineering. Our school is home to three FTC teams, two FLL teams, two Jr. FLL teams, and two Robocup teams. Our FRC team provides mentoring to all nine of these teams.  Outside of school, our team has worked with underprivileged kids to cultivate an interest in STEM, and has started a robotics program at a camp for bereaved children.  We recognize that it is our obligation to apply what we've been given toward making the world a better place.</p>
